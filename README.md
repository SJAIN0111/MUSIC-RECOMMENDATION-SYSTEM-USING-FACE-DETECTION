# MUSIC-RECOMMENDATION-SYSTEM-USING-FACE-DETECTION

IN THIS PROJECT I HAVE CREATED A MODEL WHICH RECOGNIZES A PERSONS MOOD USING HIS/HER IMAGE AND SUGGEST SONGS BASED ON THEIR MOOD.
THE PROJECT IS STRUCTURED MAJORLY INTO MOOD RECOGNISITION AND MUSIC GROUPING ON THE BASIS OF MOOD .
IN THE FIRST PART THAT IS MOOD DETECTION FER2013 DATASET OF KAGGLE IS USED ( I CANNOT UPLOAD IT HERE SINCE ITS QUITE A LARGER FILE BUT ITS AVAILABLE ON INTERNET EASILY) AND THE MODEL USED FOR THIS 
PERSON IS VCG16 WITH MORE CNN NETWORKS
THE SECOND PART THAT IS SONGS CLASSIFICATION BASED ON MMODD USES KNN ALGORITHM TO GROUP SONGS AND SUGGEST SONGS ON THE BASIS OF OUTPU OF MOOD DETECTION
